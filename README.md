<strong>Mugs Website</strong>
<br> This website is made for a specialist Mug company, it contains a nav bar, 
<br> images with overlays and a form. It is all styled using CSS.

<strong>Cinema Website</strong>
<br> This website is for a cinema and made using bootstrap 4. 
<br> It includes a jumbotron, navbar, form, images and a search bar.

<strong>Travel Website</strong>
<br> This website is travel blog to show different locations in the world. It include
<br> a nav bar, an embedded video, image conatiners with overlay and a contact form.

<strong>CSS styling Effects</strong>
<br> One of these tasks involved being able to style an image using CSS, it was about adding effects 
<br> and styling these effects such as adding filters and transitions to the image.
<br> The other task was learning how to style a nav bar using CSS effects, this was about adding hover effects 
<br> where I changed the colours and added a dropdown menu when a heading was hovered over.

<strong>Challenges-5</strong>
<br> This assignment had 11 challenges in total of varying tasks. 
<br> Challenge 1 was learning how to put filters over images using CSS.
<br> Challenge 2 was making the footer bold and into the center of the page.
<br> Challenge 3 involved making a table with HTML and styling it with padding, borders and a colour on the top row
<br> all using CSS.
<br> Challenge 4 was positioning text over an image.
<br> Challenge 5 asked me to make a nav bar with a background colour, font colour and hover effect.
<br> Challenge 6 involved making a two column layout adding a font colour and height and width to columns.
<br> Challenge 7 asked me to write a text element with a hover effect, so I created an effect where more text appears as the text 
<br> is hovered over.
<br> In Challenge 8 I created an image overlay fade.
<br> In Challenge 9 I embedded a video which autoplays on mute and on a loop.
<br> Challenge 10 is similar to Challenge 4, I positioned text over an embedded video which also plays on mute and loop.
<br> The final challenge was a small media query challenge. When the screen is resized the text changes colour.

<strong>Basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript</strong>
<br> These task were done at the start of the course, they asked me to look and learn at HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
<br> to develop an understanding of the basic tags and properties these languages have.
